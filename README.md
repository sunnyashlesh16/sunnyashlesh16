## **💼 About**  

With a solid foundation in Computer Science from the University at Buffalo, I have embarked on a dynamic journey in software engineering, blending academic excellence with hands-on industry experience. My passion for technology ignited during my master's program, where I immersed myself in the complexities of database systems, operating systems, and networking. These projects weren't just academic exercises they were stepping stones that helped me develop a deep understanding of system architecture and performance optimization.

My career began at Cognizant, where I contributed to key CVS Pharmacy projects focused on microservices, DevOps, secure authentication, and CI/CD pipelines. Later, at Caterpillar, I refined my front-end development skills with React, Next.js, Azure DevOps, and UI/UX design. As a Graduate Research Assistant at IBM & OneDataShare, I specialized in microservices architecture, utilizing Spring MVC, JPA, MongoDB, and Docker to build scalable cloud-native applications. During my internship as a Full Stack Developer at Hive-Unified Collegiate Platform, I developed a college platform featuring interactive polls, dashboards, and student onboarding using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Supabase, and NextAuth.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have honed leadership skills through various roles, which have strengthened my ability to guide and collaborate with teams effectively. My passion lies in large language models, distributed systems, and application security fields that represent the future of software engineering. This enthusiasm drives my personal projects, where I have built Chatbot for my portfolio, Advanced DevSecOps pipelines, and Real-time data warehousing solutions, leveraging modern tech stacks to push the boundaries of what's possible.

I hold certifications such as AWS Developer Associate, OCI, and Microsoft Azure Certified Data Scientist Associate, underscoring my commitment to staying at the forefront of cloud computing and AI technologies.

I believe in building solutions that are not only effective in the short term but are also scalable, secure, and future-proof. Whether optimizing database performance, implementing robust authentication systems, or developing intuitive user interfaces, I approach every challenge with a thoughtful, systematic mindset.

For me, software engineering is more than just a career it’s a passion that drives me to continuously learn, innovate, and contribute to the ever-evolving technology landscape.
